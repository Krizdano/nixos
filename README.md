# NixOS
my nixos configuration file

**NOTE** : this is still a work in progress since i am new to NixOS and is currently experimenting with it. 

My nixos setup is heavily inspired from [this set](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config) with some changes according to my preferences. I recommend looking at [here](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config#readme) for documentation.
