# NixOS
my nixos configuration file

**NOTE** : this is still a work in progress since i am new to NixOS and is currently experimenting with it. 

This nixos setup is heavily inspired from [this gentleman](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config) with some changes according to my preferences. I recommend looking at his setup for more detailed documentation.
